## Overview

This first assignment has two parts:

- The written questions below, using the math techniques we've talked about so far.
- The first part of the AI-supported paper assignment, given in the file `Paper.md`.

Upload your solutions to the written questions to the assignment I'll create on Canvas. You can type your answers in a file, or handwrite them and then scan in a PDF or upload an image. The paper deliverables will have their own submission on Canvas.

## Tips

Show your work for each question. You can use a calculator to help you with the computations. Remember to always sanity-check your answers to make sure that they're reasonable.



## Questions

### Conversions

Convert the following numbers from base-60 to their base-10 equivalents. Remember that commas are used to separate each place of the number and the semicolon separates the ones place from the fractional place.

1. 2, 3, 4
2. 1, 1 ; 1
3. 45, 30, 12, 15
4. 31 ; 59


### Arithmetic

Perform the following calculations in base-60. Tip: it may be helpful to think in terms of a clock. You can also use base-10 to check your answers.

1. 3, 30 + 5, 50
2. 6, 10 - 3, 20
3. 1, 45 ; 15 + 2, 20 ; 45

### Twisted Cistern

A rectangular cistern has been excavated. The total area is 200000 cubic meters (in base-10 notation). The height is 20 meters. The width exceeds the length by 50 meters. Use the technique of completing the square to solve for the length and width.

Repeat the problem, but now the make the length 100 meters and let the width exceed the height by 50 meters. Solve for the width and height. Tip: does the solution method really need to change?


### Terms and Conditions

Do some research into the word *algorithm*. What is its origin? What are the properties that theorists have decided that a procedure should have to be considered a valid algorithm?

Give an example of a procedure that isn't really an algorithm.

Evaluate the first example from the Knuth paper according to your conditions. Are the procedures described in the Babylonian tablets algorithms?


### Roots

Use the Babylonian square root algorithm to calculate the square root of 10201 (in base-10). Use *x*<sub>0</sub> = 1 as the starting point.


### This is the procedure.

A rectangular field exists. The area of the field is 60 and the length exceeds the width by 7.

1. Draw a picture of this scenario.

2. Use completion of the square to solve for the length and width.

3. Write the solution procedure for this problem in the style of a Babylonian tablet.
