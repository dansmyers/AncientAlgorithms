## Overview

Complete the problems given below. I will add a few more problems to this set once we've unlocked a few more techniques in class.

Complete the seond phase of the paper project described in `Paper.md`.


## Problems

### Egyptian multiplication

Calculate the following products using the Egyptian multiplication technique.

- 67 x 8
- 113 x 12
- 77 x 21


### Peasant multiplication

Repeat the same problems given above, but use the peasant multiplication technique.


### Binary Peasants

Multiply the binary numbers `11010` and `1001` using the peasant multiplication technique.


### Circles

There is a circular field of diameter 99. What is its area?

- Calculate the true answer and then the answer using the Egyptian approximation
- Find the percent error in your estimation

Suppose that you used the modern approximation of 22/7 for the value of pi. What would be the percentage error in that case?

### Series

- There are 11 houses
- Each house has 11 cats
- Each cat has 11 kittens
- Each kitten eats 11 mice
- Each mouse had eaten 11 seeds
- Each seed would have yielded 11 units of grain
- Each unit of grain would have baked 11 loaves
- Each loaf would have been split by 11 men
- Each man has 11 children
- Each child has 11 letters in its name

What is the sum of all the enumerated things?

Calculate your answer using the formula for the geometric series.
