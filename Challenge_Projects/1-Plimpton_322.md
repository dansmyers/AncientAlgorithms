## Overview

Plimpton 322 is a cuneiform tablet dating from about 1800 BCE. It's named for George Plimpton, a New York publisher who assembled a collection of antiquities that he bequeathed to Columbia University in the 1930s.

The tablet contains a table with columns listing pairs of numbers that can be used to form *Pythagorean triples*. That is, it lists values of *a* and *c* (in base-60 cuneifrom representation) that would satisfy *a*<sup>2</sup> + *b*<sup>2</sup> = *c*<sup>2</sup> for a corresponding *b*. [The Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322) has a transcription of the table's content with the numbers translated into modern notation.

This table is interesting, because it appears to show a level of mathematical sophistication beyond what historians generally attribute to the Babylonian period. Babylonians knew of the Pythagorean theorm, as we've seen in some of our examples, but having a method to produce a table of Pythagorean triples (in an orderly way) is a more challenging problem.

Scholars have tried to understand the process for how the table might have been constructed, with arguments that its author must have had a surprisingly advanced understanding of number theory or trigonometry.

In this project, you're going to read a 2002 paper about Plimpton 322 by Eleanor Robson, British assyriologist (a scholar who studies the ancient near East). In it, Robson digs into the actual cultural and linguistic content of the tablet and uses those facts to understand its mathematics. We're going to use this Robon's paper to practice your literature reading skills and the art of summarizing a paper.

## The Literature Review

When you complete a thesis, it's traditional to include a section that review the relevant literature. A good literature review will

- Equip you with background knowledge you need for your thesis
- Provide the body of references you'll use in your work
- Demonstrate to your reviewers that you have done sufficient background research and have an understanding of your topic area

Three common problems plague the thesis literature review:

1. Doing the minimum and ending up with a literature review that's too sparse to show any understanding of the area.

2. The opposite: taking forever with the lit review and refusing to move on the actual thesis. This is a favorite procrastination technique of insecure grad students.

3. A review that summarizes a more-or-less random set of tangentially related papers, with no regard for their relationships or relative importance. This is what you get if you base your research on the top links returned by Google Scholar.

A good literature review is more than a summary of several articles. Rather, it should be a concise overview of the **most important work and key background information** related to your topic. The focus of your review should be on **identifying and summarizing relevant and influential articles**.


## Process

When you read a paper for your review, your ultimate goal should be to produce a **concise one paragraph summary of its main points**.

- What is the point of the paper?
- What are its key methods or data sources?
- What conclusions do the authors draw?
- Ultimately, how is it relevant to your topic?

You'll then use these summaries to help write the literature review section of your thesis.

### Step 1: Background work

Sometimes jumping into a paper directly is not the best path. Start by reading [this article](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/dont-fall-for-babylonian-trigonometry-hype/) from *Scientific American* that gives some more background on the table's contents.

### Step 2: Read the paper

Start working your way through the Robson paper, which I've included in this directory. On your first pass through the paper, don't try to read for intense detail. Focus on the high-level goals of each section. The first part of the paper restates the background of the tablet that was in the Step 1 article, so it should feel familiar to you.

When you start to get bogged down, take a break. This is not a race and the paper isn't going anywhere. In particular, you'll probably hit your first wall at the bottom of page 3, which summarizes the mathematical explanations for the content of the tablet. It turns out that these details are not that important for understanding the rest of the paper, so you don't have to worry about them.


#### More detail on the construction methods

Briefly, though, the paper considers three theories for how the tablet was generated:

1. Using trigonometry functions. It's possible to interpret the Plimpton columns in terms of trig operations. The problem with this theory is that we have no evidence of real trigonometry in the Babylonian period.

2. Using *generating functions*. This is a process that would allow you to produce the triples in the table in a structured way in terms of some smaller numbers. The math has to do with choosing what those numbers are.

3. The *reciprocal pairs* theory, which says that each row of the table is calculated by starting with a number *x* and its reciprocal 1/*x*.

The next sections consider each of these theories. The first two are dismissed and the third becomes the focus of the last part of the paper.

### Step 3: Section summaries

Go back and read the paper again and produce a bulleted outline of the main points of each section.

Remember: Your goal is to **summarize** the content of the section, not duplicate every sentence.

- For example, take a look at the first paragraph of the paper. There's a bunch of stuff going on there, but the high-level summary is "Ancient math has to be understood in its historical context".

- The following paragraphs show an example looking at how the Babylonians drew triangles. I could summarize this section as, "Ancients conceived of basic math objects differently than modern people". The triangle example is illustrative, but its details are not the ultimate focus of the paper.

- The third paragraph could be summarized as, "Historical context will allow us to choose between the interpretations of Plimpton 322".

Summarizing paragraphs is a good rule of thumb, but you may occasionally need more than one point per paragraph. If, however, you find yourself making one point per *sentence*, that's probably too much, unless it's truly a key section of the paper.

### Step 4: Summary paragraph

Use your section outline to produce a condensed one-paragraph summary of the entire paper, roughly four to six sentences. You could think of this as an alternative abstract, but one customized to the points that are most relevant to your own research.

## Submission

Turn in a document containing your section outline and your one paragraph summary to the assignment I'll create on Canvas.
