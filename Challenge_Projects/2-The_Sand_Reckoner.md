# Challenge Project: *The Sand Reckoner*

## Due

## Overview

*The Sand Reckoner* is a manuscript by Archimedes, written as a letter to the king of Syracuse. In it, Archimedes lays out an argument that it's possible to count the number of grains of sand that would fill the entire universe. This requires him to do two interesting things:

1. Estimate the size of the universe, which Archimedes does using a model proposed Aristarchus of Samos, an earlier astronomer. The model of Aristarchus is *heliocentric*, making this one of the earliest theories that assumes the Earth and planets move about the sun.

2. Develop a method for representing very large numbers. Greek numbers used a system where different letters stood for different magnitudes. Their largest standard number was the *myriad*, which equaled 10000. Archimedes designs a place-value number system using the *myriad of myriads* (that is, 10000 * 10000 = 100 million) as its base unit.

Archimedes' goal in making this argument is less about producing a real accurate estimate of the grains of sand that could fit in the universe, and more about showing that it's possible to calculate with quantities that would have been, by the standards of the time, unimaginably huge.

## The Assignment

I thought about making you read *The Sand Reckoner* and then answer some questions about it, or something, but that's boring.

Instead: You're going to **design your own assignment** based on *The Sand Reckoner*. This has three parts:

- Read and understand the core concepts of the manuscript. My notes and links below will help you get started.

- Develop an assignment that a hypothetical student could do based on the work. This *could* be a set of questions or a writing prompt, but you can choose another option if you like. Your assignment must give specific learning goals your student will demonstrate by performing it.

- Map the goals of your assignment to the levels of **Bloom's Taxonomy**, a model of the complexity of learning tasks, described below.

Note that you don't have to *do* your own assignment. It's enough to design one, state its learning goals, and map them to Bloom's Taxonomy. You should, however, choose something could feasibly be done by a potential student.


## Notes

### The manuscript

A paraphrased copy of the manuscript is [available here](https://www.ucolick.org/~laugh/reckoner.shtml). This is much easier to read than the regular translated text and lays out the key ideas in more modern notation. Start by reading the beginning, then look at my notes below, then come back and work through the rest of the manuscript.

After the introduction, there are three major sections, each laying out one part of Archimedes' argument:

1. A derivation of the size of the universe, using the heliocentric model of Aristarchus

2. A system for representing big numbers based on units of 100 million

3. A scaling argument that starts with the grains of sand that could fit in a poppy seed and builds up to the estimated number of grains of sand that could fit in the universe


### The size of the universe

Aristarchus's original writing describing his heliocentric model is lost. We do have other writings by him and use a geocentric model and perform gnarly feats of trigonometry to do things like estimate the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon.

The model is similar to our current conception of the solar system, with the Sun at the center and the earth and other planets moving in circular orbits about it. Much, much, *much* further away is the "sphere of fixed stars", representing the stationary stars.
